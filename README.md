octopart-gdocs-addin
====================

Inspired by [octopart.com/excel](http://octopart.com/excel) add-in, this add-in would become a full featured Octopart Google Docs interface, someday :)

Please hold on, just a hack now, will improve soon.

Status
------

API does not work yet! There is only one function (`OCTOPART_DISTRIBUTOR_PRICE`) with a very simple implementation. It uses Octopart API but is far from complete.

See some screenshots below.

How to use?
===========

Try this Google Docs sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zuFXMkAFfmUL6XEdKf3FWNRL8KiE_WCXQypv1Ze4atw/edit?usp=sharing). The add-in is installed there, just use or copy it. Go to Tools -> Script Editor if you want to see/change the code.
