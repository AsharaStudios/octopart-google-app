# octopart-google-app

Inspired by [octopart.com/excel](http://octopart.com/excel) add-in, this add-on would become a full featured Octopart Google Apps interface, someday :)

Please hold on, just a hack now, will improve soon.

# Status

Addon if feature complete compared to Excel add-in. But some work still needed to make sure everything is really alright (yes, I mean tests!).

See some screenshots below.

# How to use?

Try this Google Sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zuFXMkAFfmUL6XEdKf3FWNRL8KiE_WCXQypv1Ze4atw/edit?usp=sharing). The add-on is installed there, just use or copy it. Go to Tools -> Script Editor if you want to see/change the code.
